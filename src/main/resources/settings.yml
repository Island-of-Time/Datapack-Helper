# to the player on request.
# Additionally, a new folder named 'global' will be created here including all auto-generated assets.

#
# - Texturepack Groups
# Create unique groups that will be usable to request.
# A group always grabs all folders from the 'texturepack' folder to combine
# it into a single texturepack except all folders named like groups. The group
# will use its own folder.
# If a player has a group tag, the texturepack will automatically load on joining.

#
# - Show pink glass
